        <p class="text-white-50">
          I’ve designed multiple web & mobile experiences for multi-cross-platform devices from TV to iPads, etc.
          I’ve worked with small agencies and medium-sized companies. I previously worked with one of India’s 
          largest Ed-Tech startups, Toppr, which later got acquired by Byjus. Currently, I’m designing aesthetic 
          and functional solutions for smallcase within the invest team, to enhance financial accessibility and 
          understanding for Indian users.
